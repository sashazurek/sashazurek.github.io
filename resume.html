                I worked with the Platform Execution team, and was primarily responsible for maintaining
                developer workflows in <a href="https://github.com/sifive/wake">Wake</a> for processor builds.
                I took ownership over the development of a new workflow for gate-level simulation, using Synopsys
                tools, that previously was not a part of our automated build pipeline. I was also responsible for
                maintianing processor "build plans", the spec files that determined what kind of processor would
                be built, the memories associated with it, and what external tools to interface and use as part
                of the build.

                I worked with the Architecture team, primarily in performance
                characterization and analysis of NVMe SSDs. The bulk of this was
                spent developing and maintaining an automation toolset for our
                internal characterization workloads. The tool uses industry-standard
                tools like <a href="https://github.com/axboe/fio">FIO</a> and
                <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> inside a
                Python framework to automatically run I/O tests and assemble an
                Excel spreadsheet. This spreadsheet included graphs for each part of
                the workload, plotting both IOPS and separated read/write latency against
                time. This toolset saved my team an entire 8 hour day's worth of
                effort from the previous workflow, which was a mostly manual process.

                Secondarily, I assisted on numerous tasks that were given on an

            I shadowed the Connected Customer and Mobility Solutions team, following
            their work on the iOS port of the myBrand app family (myChevrolet, myBuick, etc).
            I was also given the opportunity to help research and promote design ideas for
            the myBrand apps.
